Library building routines for the sciReptor toolkit
---------------------------------------------------

This set of scripts builds and installs the reference libraries (both internal
and BLAST) required by sciReptor. It additionally sets up metadata tables
required for processing of matrix scPCR data.

#####Used reference sequence libraries
1. _Mus musculus_, as provided by IgBLAST
2. _Homo sapiens_, as provided by  IMGT
3. _Mus musculus_ (C57BL/6 strain), an own manual build based on the NCBIm38
   assembly as provided by Ensembl.

Please note that libraries 1 and 2 are **not** included in this repo but will
be downloaded from their respective sites upon build, to ensure that you
will install the most recent version.

Library 3 is a complete reference library for the C57BL/6 strain. It is based
on the NCBI mouse genome assemblies 37 and 38 and has been extensively 
cross-checked for accurate segment boundaries.


###Installation

Please follow the steps described in the [sciReptor installation guide](https://github.com/b-cell-immunology/sciReptor/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md#installing-and-running-scireptor).
